# BT5153_group12

This repository contains the code from Group 12 for the report entitled 'Machine Learning Model-Assisted Detection of Kidney Tumors/Cysts/Stones'

The notebooks can be read in this order:
1. Model Specification & Evaluation - contains code for model building and model evaluation 
2. Slice-Based Evaluation - LR & RF - contains code for the logistic regression and random forest when separate models were built for coronal & transverse type scans plus the evaluation for these different scans
3. Slice-Based Evaluation - CNN - contains code for CNN models when separate models were built for coronal & transverse type scans plus the evaluation for these different scans
4. XAI - LR Coefficients - model interpretability for logistic regression 
5. XAI - RF LIME - model interpretability for random forest
6. XAI - CNN LIME - model interpretability for CNN using LIME
7. XAI - CNN GradCAM - model interpretability for CNN using GradCAM
